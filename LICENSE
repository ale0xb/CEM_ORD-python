   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work and Derivative Works thereof, and to permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so, provided that:

   (c) You preserve the copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty contained in the Work.

3. Attribution.
   You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses you or your use.

4. Disclaimer of Warranty.
   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

5. Limitation of Liability.
   In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 shall survive any termination of this License.

9. Miscellaneous.
   This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed hereunder. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
